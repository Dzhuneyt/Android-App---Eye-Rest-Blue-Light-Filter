"Sore eyes" or "itchiness" are common side effects of too much smartphone usage, especially in dark environments, e.g. in your bed at night. People usually go darken the screen as much as possible, but even the lowest setting is often not comfortable for prolonged usage.

Eye Rest makes it easy to apply a blue light filter that overlays the screen and reduces emitted light, reducing eye strain.

**Features:**
- Control the amount of intensity of the blue light filter (overlay)

- Enable a scheduler that will only enable the blue light filter in a scheduled interval (e.g. only at night)
